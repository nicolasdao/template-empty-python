# EMPTY PYTHON3 PROJECT

> Delete this text until the Table of contents.

This (almost) empty project helps getting started with Python3. This project contains six dev dependencies:
- `easypipinstall` to maintain dependencies in a similar fashion to NPM.
- `black` to clean and format your code to follow the Python conventions.
- `flake8` to lint.
- `pytest` to run unit and functional tests.
- `build` to optionally build your package.
- `twine` to optionally publish your package to PyPI.

`black`, `flake8` and `pytest` are executed sequentially via the `make t` command, while `build` is executed via the `make b` command and `twine` is executed via `make p` or `make bp` (build and then publish). To learn more about what those commands do and how to configure them, please refer to these sections: 
- [Install dependencies with `easypipinstall`](#install-dependencies-with-easypipinstall)
- [Linting, formatting and testing](#linting-formatting-and-testing)
- [Building and distributing this package](#building-and-distributing-this-package)

To install this template:

```
npx degit https://github.com/nicolasdao/template-empty-python.git YOUR_PROJECT_NAME
```

Then run, the following commands to initialize this project:

```
cd YOUR_PROJECT_NAME; \
python3 -m venv .venv; \
source .venv/bin/activate; \
pip install --upgrade pip; \
pip install -r requirements.txt; \
mv ./src/empty-python ./src/YOUR_PROJECT_NAME
```

If you're using Linux or Mac, all those commands can be combined as follow:

```
func() { \
	npx degit https://github.com/nicolasdao/template-empty-python.git $1; \
	cd $1; \
	python3 -m venv .venv; \
	source .venv/bin/activate; \
	pip install --upgrade pip; \
	pip install -r requirements.txt; \
	mv ./src/empty-python ./src/$1
}; func YOUR_PROJECT_NAME
```

# Dev
## CLI commands

| Command | Description |
|:--------|:------------|
| `source .venv/bin/activate` | Activate the virtual environment |
| `deactivate` | Deactivate the virtual environment |
| `make b` | Builds the package. |
| `make p` | Publish the package to https://pypi.org. |
| `make bp` | Builds the package and then publish it to https://pypi.org. |
| `make bi` | Builds the package and install it locally (`pip install -e .`). |
| `make install` | Install the dependencies defined in the `requirements.txt`. This file contains all the dependencies (i.e., both prod and dev). |
| `make install-prod` | Install the dependencies defined in the `prod-requirements.txt`. This file only contains the production dependencies. |
| `make n` | Starts a Jupyter notebook for this project. |
| `make t` | Formats adnd then lints the project. |
| `easyi numpy` | Instals `numpy` and update `setup.cfg`, `prod-requirements.txt` and `requirements.txt`. |
| `easyi flake8 -D` | Instals `flake8` and update `setup.cfg` and `requirements.txt`. |
| `easyu numpy` | Uninstals `numpy` and update `setup.cfg`, `prod-requirements.txt` and `requirements.txt`. |

## Install dependencies with `easypipinstall`

`easypipinstall` adds two new CLI utilities: `easyi` (install) and `easyu` (uninstall).

Examples:
```
easyi numpy
```

This installs `numpy` (via `pip install`) then automatically updates the following files:
- `setup.cfg` (WARNING: this file must already exists):
	```
	[options]
	install_requires = 
		numpy
	```
- `requirements.txt` and `prod-requirements.txt`

```
easyi flake8 black -D
```

This installs `flake8` and `black` (via `pip install`) then automatically updates the following files:
- `setup.cfg` (WARNING: this file must already exists):
	```
	[options.extras_require]
	dev = 
		black
		flake8
	```
- `requirements.txt` only, as those dependencies are installed for development purposes only.

```
easyu flake8
```

This uninstalls `flake8` as well as all its dependencies. Those dependencies are uninstalled only if they are not used by other project dependencies. The `setup.cfg` and `requirements.txt` are automatically updated accordingly.

## Linting, formatting and testing

```
make t
```

This command runs the following three python executables:

```
black ./
flake8 ./
pytest --capture=no --verbose $(testpath)
```

- `black` formats all the `.py` files, while `flake8` lints them. 
- `black` is configured in the `pyproject.toml` file under the `[tool.black]` section.
- `flake8` is configured in the `setup.cfg` file under the `[flake8]` section.
- `pytest` runs all the `.py` files located under the `tests` folder. The meaning of each option is as follow:
	- `--capture=no` allows the `print` function to send outputs to the terminal. 
	- `--verbose` displays each test. Without it, the terminal would only display the count of how many passed and failed.
	- `$(testpath)` references the `testpath` variable. This variable is set to `tests` (i.e., the `tests` folder) by default. This allows to override this default variable with something else (e.g., a specific test to only run that one).

### Ignoring `flake8` errors

This project is pre-configured to ignore certain `flake8` errors. To add or remove `flake8` errors, update the `extend-ignore` property under the `[flake8]` section in the `setup.cfg` file.

### Skipping tests

In your test file, add the `@pytest.mark.skip()` decorator. For example:

```python
import pytest

@pytest.mark.skip()
def test_self_describing_another_test_name():
	# ... your test here
```

### Executing a specific test only

One of the output of the `make t` command is list of all the test that were run (PASSED and FAILED). For example:

```
tests/error/test_catch_errors.py::test_catch_errors_basic PASSED
tests/error/test_catch_errors.py::test_catch_errors_wrapped PASSED
tests/error/test_catch_errors.py::test_catch_errors_nested_errors PASSED
tests/error/test_catch_errors.py::test_catch_errors_StackedException_arbitrary_inputs FAILED
```

To execute a specific test only, add the `testpath` option with the test path. For example, to execute the only FAILED test in the example above, run this command:

```
make t testpath=tests/error/test_catch_errors.py::test_catch_errors_StackedException_arbitrary_inputs
```

## Building and distributing this package

> Tl;dr, `make bp` builds and publishes your package to https://pypi.org.

To build your package, run:

```
make b
```

This command is a wrapper around `python3 -m build`.

To build and publish your package to https://pypi.org, run:

```
make p
```

This command is a wrapper around the following commands:

```
python3 -m build; \
twine upload dist/*
```

Those two steps have been bundled in a single command:

```
make bp
```

To test your package locally before deploying it to https://pypi.org, you can run build and install it locally with this command:

```
make bi
```

This command buils the package and follows with `pip install -e .`.
